# Alterdle

Alterdle is a fully customisable word guessing game.

For the first time ever it allows users to choose how many words to guess at once (between 1 and 16) as well as how long each word is (between 1 and 11 letters), resulting in 162 unique daily puzzles!!

This game chooses words at random, so it will occasionally choose obscure or inappropriate ones. If you find a particularly offensive wordplease consider contributing to the project

This game was built on top of the open source project [cwackerfuss/react-wordle](https://github.com/cwackerfuss/react-wordle). Made using React, Typescript, and Tailwind.
